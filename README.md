## 📁 Projects

### 1. 🎓 Student Performance Predictor

- 📌 **Description**: This project uses a machine learning model to predict student academic performance based on various features like study hours, parental education, test preparation, etc.
- 📂 **Dataset**: Student performance dataset (custom or UCI-based)
- 🛠 **Technologies Used**:
  - Python
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn / Matplotlib
- 💡 **Key Steps**:
  - Data preprocessing (handling categorical features and missing values)
  - Visualization of features vs performance
  - Model training (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- 📊 **Output**: Predicted scores or grades based on student attributes

### 2. 🛍️ Product Categorization using Machine Learning

- 📌 **Description**: A classification model that categorizes product titles into predefined classes using text data.
- 📂 **Dataset**: Product listing dataset (custom or scraped)
- 🛠 **Technologies Used**:
  - Python
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow / Keras
  - TF-IDF for text vectorization
- 💡 **Key Steps**:
  - Text preprocessing: tokenization, lowercasing, punctuation removal
  - Feature extraction using TF-IDF
  - Model building with a neural network
- 📊 **Output**: Multi-class label prediction with training and validation accuracy
